**Join a community of students and educators who are having fun working and learning together.**

Our invitation-only Discord community is a place where you can find a mentor, get help with your project, and meet other students who are interested in AI and Robotics. 

This site is organized into a few major sections. Starting for the terminology we use around projects: 

- **Tier 0** projects require a long-term commitment to the domain they belong to and this usually translates to a 6-month or more effort by typically a team of 2-3 students. 
- **Tier 1** projects require a medium-term commitment of 3 months and although they can be undertaken by a single student, they are more suitable for a team of 2 students.  
- **Tier 2** projects are suitable for a class / course project and they can be completed in 1 month by a single sudent.

In addition we host here guides that can be used to get you up to speed to topics associated with **systems** and MLOps  such as containers, streaming platforms, K8s and others.  

- **How to** guides - we summarise here how to do things such as how to use a specific tool or how to set up a specific environment. Contributions are welcome via pull requests. 
- **Tutorials** on specific topics - we summarise here youtube series from us or other creators.  Contributions are welcome via pull requests.

This project will help you get on with infrastructure / framework level code for both the cliet (browser) as well as the cloud. The goal is to create a framework for running machine learning pipelines using webassembly components. This will allow us to run perception machine learning in the browser or in the cloud without tight coupling with specific language runtimes.
