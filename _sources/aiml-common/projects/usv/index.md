# Unmanned Surface Vehicle Navigation

**This is currently a placeholderand this page refers to the older 2022 ROS1 setup**. Detailed instructions will be published soon for ROS2 that are suitable for the [2023 competition](https://robotx.org/programs/vrx-2023/).

Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USV) are heavily researched at present for both civilian and defense applications. You will participate in the VRX 2022 competition and immerse yourself in a virtual environment in ROS while at the same time learn the domain of maritime navigation. 

To navigate a robot and complete you will be implement the whole stack of an AI agent from perception to thruster control. Please note that this project is only open to students with at least a 2070 / 3070 RTX GPU hosted by a capable desktop computer with at least 16GB of RAM. You can also use AWS resources (Robomaker) for this project but be warned that the cost may be appreciable. 


## System Setup

Follow the instructions in [here](https://github.com/osrf/vrx/wiki/system_setup_tutorials). make sure you follow the  _container_ setup option. Coordinate with your team to ensure access to the AWS workspace provided by Pantelis **solely for the use in this project**.
