**Join a community of students and educators who are having fun working and learning together.**

Our invitation-only Discord community is a place where you can find a mentor, get help with your project, and meet other students who are interested in AI and Robotics. 

This site is organized into a few major sections. Starting for the terminology we use around projects: 

- **Tier 0** projects require a long-term commitment to the domain they belong to and this usually translates to a 6-month or more effort by typically a team of 2-3 students. 
- **Tier 1** projects require a medium-term commitment of 3 months and although they can be undertaken by a single student, they are more suitable for a team of 2 students.  
- **Tier 2** projects are suitable for a class / course project and they can be completed in 1 month by a single sudent.

In addition we host here guides that can be used to get you up to speed to topics associated with **systems** and MLOps  such as containers, streaming platforms, K8s and others.  

- **How to** guides - we summarise here how to do things such as how to use a specific tool or how to set up a specific environment. Contributions are welcome via pull requests. 
- **Tutorials** on specific topics - we summarise here youtube series from us or other creators.  Contributions are welcome via pull requests.
