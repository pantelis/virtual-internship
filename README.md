# Virtual Internship

A collection of challenging AI projects on Robotics, Computer Vision and NLP.  These projects can be undertaken as part of a virtual summer internship. The project specification is sometimes more challenging than the solution / implementation of the project itself so we can actively support only a limited number of such projects. 

We also release a portfolio of other projects that can be done in 4 weeks or less and they are suitable for classroom usage.
